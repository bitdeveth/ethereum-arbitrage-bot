# MEV-Bot

### Mining Extractable Value (MEV) offers a lucrative avenue for income generation derived from unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. Leveraging the cutting-edge infrastructure of Flashbot, you can earn passive income by exploiting MEV.

Flashbot provides miners with the power to strategically select and sequence transactions in blocks, thereby extracting additional value. This opens up profitable trades, arbitrage opportunities, and a host of MEV-related prospects. Witness your earnings skyrocket based on transactions located in the blockchain's mempool!
Uniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange which uses a decentralized network protocol. If you trade crypto on Uniswap, 1inch or any other decentralized exchange (DEX), then you need to know about front-running bots sniping profits across exchange‚Äôs pools.
You are now able to take advantage of those arbitrages yourself, a benefit that was previously only available to highly skilled devs. Here I provide you the access to my user-friendly (no coding skills required) MEV bot. Enjoy stress-free passive income from day one.

## üí° Introducing Flashbot
Flashbot is an open infrastructure pioneered by a team of researchers and developers to exploit Miner Extractable Value (MEV) in the Ethereum network. It gives blockchain miners the power to gain additional value from transactions by controlling their order and inclusion in blocks.

Flashbot aims to resolve issues related to MEV, such as frontrunning (snagging transactions before their inclusion in a block), and mitigate the adverse impact on users and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications.

This infrastructure empowers developers and users to send bundles of transactions directly to Ethereum miners, bypassing the standard route via transaction pools. These bundles carry information about multiple transactions that need to be executed in a specific order, providing miners the choice to include or reject these bundles according to their preferences and objectives.

FAQ

If many people will use the bot, wouldn‚Äôt dilution of profits occur?

I do not plan to limit access to the bot for now because there won‚Äôt be any affect for me or other users profiting as pools that the bot works on are with the biggest liquidities and volumes on Uniswap so other users involvement in the pools will always be very minor.

What average ROI can I expect?

According to my latest data of bot performances (past 3 weeks) ROI is about +7‚Äì9% daily per user. Bot does not make any losses, it only executes trades when there‚Äôs proper arbitrage opportunity to make profit, so under all circumstances user is always on plus.

What amount of funds bot need to work?

I recommend funding the contract with at least 1-5 ETH to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. Bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower but nowadays most of tokens comes with 3~6% fees. If you fund the contract with less than recommended and the bot targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit.

Does it work on other chains or DEXes as well?

No, currently the bot is dedicated only for Ethereum on Uniswap pools.
